# bwatch_rev2
Hey, it's remake version of my old project (bwatch)[https://github.com/HoangViet93/beewatch]. </br>
I re-design it by use `Makefile` and `gcc` instead of KeilC and cut-off some uncomplete feature like 
zigbee and focus to most useful things. </br>
Here are some things my watch can do:
- measure heart rate
- stopwatch, analog and digital clock
- activity status
